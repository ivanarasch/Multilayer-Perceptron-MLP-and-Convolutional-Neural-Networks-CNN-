he CIFAR10 is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, labeled over 10 categories. See more info at the CIFAR homepage Links to an external site..The CIFAR10 dataset can be accessed from Tensorflow/Keras. You can use the code here to load the dataset: CIFAR10_HW.ipynb

Download CIFAR10_HW.ipynb. Use the train and test datasets as provided.

Task 1: MLP model for image classification

    Transform the images into a vector (1D) representation appropriate for MLP 
    Train a MLP model on the 1D training set 
    Tune the hyper-parameters of the MLP model and see if you get over 50% accuracy on test set

Task 2: CNN model for image classification

    Train a CNN on the 2D training set 
    Tune the hyper-parameters of the CNN model and see if you get over 65% accuracy on test set 

Task 3: Compare MLP and CNN models

    Report the training, validation, and testing accuracy results for both the MLP and CNN models. 
    Discuss your observations
